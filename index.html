            <p>In CSS, ::after creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element. It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.</p>

            <code>
                /* Add an arrow after links */
                a::after {
                  content: "→";
                }
            </code>

            <ul>
                <li>Note: The pseudo-elements generated by ::before and ::after are contained by the element's formatting box, 
                    and thus don't apply to replaced elements such as img, or to br elements.</li>
            </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="::backdrop">
        <header>::backdrop</header>
        <article>
            <p>The ::backdrop CSS pseudo-element is a box the size of the viewport which is rendered immediately beneath any element 
                being presented in full-screen mode. This includes both elements which have been placed in full-screen mode using the 
                Fullscreen API and dialog elements.</p>
            <p>When multiple elements have been placed into full-screen mode, the backdrop is drawn immediately beneath the frontmost 
                such element, and on top of the older full-screen elements.</p>

            <code>
                /* Backdrop is only displayed when dialog is opened with dialog.showModal() */
                dialog::backdrop {
                  background: rgba(255,0,0,.25);
                }
            </code>
            <p>All full-screen elements are placed in a last-in/first out (LIFO) stack in the top layer, which is a special layer in the 
                viewport which is always rendered last (and therefore on top) before drawing the viewport's contents to the screen. 
                The ::backdrop pseudo-element makes it possible to obscure, style, or completely hide everything located below the element 
                when it's the topmost one in the top layer.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>::backdrop neither inherits from nor is inherited by any other elements. No restrictions are made on what properties 
                    apply to this pseudo-element.</li>
            </ul>

        <article>
            <p>In CSS, ::before creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element. It is often used to add 
                cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.</p>

            <code>
                /* Add a heart before links */
                a::before {
                  content: "♥";
                }
            </code>

            <ul>
                <li>Note: The pseudo-elements generated by ::before and ::after are contained by the element's formatting box, and thus 
                    don't apply to replaced elements such as img, or to br elements.</li>

        <article>
            <p>The ::cue CSS pseudo-element matches WebVTT cues within a selected element. This can be used to style captions and other 
                cues in media with VTT tracks.</p>

            <code>
                ::cue {
                  color: yellow;
                  font-weight: bold;
                }
            </code>

            <p>Rules with ::cue in their selectors are limited to using only CSS properties from the following list:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>background and its longhand properties</li>
                <li>color</li>

            <code>

    <section class="main-section" id="::first-letter">
        <header>::first-letter</header>
        <article>
            <p>The ::first-letter CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the first letter of the first line of a block-level element, 
                but only when not preceded by other content (such as images or inline tables).</p>

            <code>
                /* Selects the first letter of a p */
                p::first-letter {
                  font-size: 130%;
                }
            </code>

            <p>The first letter of an element is not always trivial to identify:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Punctuation that precedes or immediately follows the first letter is included in the match. Punctuation includes any 
                    Unicode character defined in the open (Ps), close (Pe), initial quote (Pi), final quote (Pf), and other 
                    punctuation (Po) classes.</li>
                <li>Some languages have digraphs that are always capitalized together, like the IJ in Dutch. In these cases, both 
                    letters of the digraph should be matched by the ::first-letter pseudo-element. (This is poorly supported by 
                    browsers; see the browser compatibility table below.)</li>
                <li>A combination of the ::before pseudo-element and the content property may inject some text at the beginning 
                    of the element. In that case, ::first-letter will match the first letter of this generated content.</li>
            </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="::first-line">
        <header>::first-line</header>
        <article>
            <p>The ::first-line CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the first line of a block-level element. Note that the length of the 
                first line depends on many factors, including the width of the element, the width of the document, and the font size 
                of the text.</p>

            <code>
                /* Selects the first line of a p */
                p::first-line {
                  color: red;
                }
            </code>

            <p>Only a small subset of CSS properties can be used with the ::first-line pseudo-element:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>All font-related properties: font, font-kerning, font-style, font-variant, font-variant-numeric, 
                    font-variant-position, font-variant-east-asian, font-variant-caps, font-variant-alternates, font-variant-ligatures, 
                    font-synthesis, font-feature-settings, font-language-override, font-weight, font-size, font-size-adjust, 
                    font-stretch, and font-family</li>

                <li>All background-related properties: background-color, background-clip, background-image, background-origin, 
                    background-position, background-repeat, background-size,  background-attachment, and background-blend-mode</li>
                <li>The color property</li>
                <li>word-spacing, letter-spacing, text-decoration, text-transform, and line-height</li>
                <li>text-shadow, text-decoration, text-decoration-color, text-decoration-line, text-decoration-style, and 
                    vertical-align.</li>
